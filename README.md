# FORMS in react

This is the exercise we saw in class on how to use forms in react.

Remember to install the dependencies with `npm install` and run the project with `npm run dev`.

The `onChange` event is used to update the state of the component with the value of the input.

We use the `onClick` event to submit the form and call the `handleSubmit` function. And we use the `e.preventDefault()` to avoid the default behaviour of the form, which is to refresh the page.
